# mem-admin (MEM MMT)
ESM is a project of the Environmental Assessment Office in partnership with the OCIO DevOps Pathfinder.

MEM MMT is an offshoot derivative of the ESM application to support the Major Mines Transparency project of the Ministry of Energy and Mines.

This application is a tool to support the work of EAO staff, project proponents, and other stakeholders as environmental assessments are conducted.

## Features

The features provided by the web-based ESM application include:

* a public-facing view of documents related to proposed development projects
* the ability to comment on projects
* as tools to support EAO staff, proponents, and stakeholders in performing tasks related to the environmental review process.

## Usage

## Developer Requirements

mem-admin has been built using MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and NodeJS.  See http://mean.js/ for more information on the project's development stack. Basic globally install requirements for Win32, OSX, or Linux are as follows:
* node@ >= 6.11.3
* npm@ >= 2.15.1 (only for installing yarn)
* mongodb-server@ >= 2.6.x
* grunt@ >= 0.4.5
* git
* yarn >= 1.3.2

## Functional Tests

To run the functional tests use "grunt runfunctional"
This will go through these steps:
* Setup a functional test instance of the database
* Spin up a functional test instance of the application
* Spin up automated testing of the functional test instance of the application

Note that you need the following env vars:
* FUNCTIONAL_PORT=3001 -- used to server the functional test instance of the application
* FUNCTIONAL_HOST=localhost -- location of the functional test instance of the application
* BASEURL=http://localhost:3001 -- the url targeted by the functional tests
* MONGODB_FUNC_HOST=localhost -- the host for the mongo instance targeted by the functional test instance of the application
* MONGODB_FUNC_PORT=27017 -- port for the mongo instance targeted by the functional test instance of the application
* MONGODB_FUNC_DATABASE=mem-dev-func -- name of the database used by the functional test instance of the application


Note that you need to have an instance of the Mongo DBMS running for this to work.
This was initially set up on Ubuntu where the Mongo DBMS was running as a service
